            <p>My crochet journey began in 2020, during the year of Covid. Like many people, I needed something to help me unwind, and I stumbled upon crochet through YouTube tutorials. Once I put my mind to it, I went all in. What started as a hobby quickly grew into something more, I made little pieces for my family, and soon small orders began to come in.</p>

            <p class="highlight-text">
                Today, Fay's Crochet specializes in unique, made-to-order garments and cozy pieces, including heirloom-quality baby blankets, customizable children's cardigans, and stylish adult patchwork sweaters, all designed to be cherished, lasting items.
            </p>

            <p>For me, crocheting is more than just a craft. It‚Äôs an art form; like cooking, baking, or drawing. You start with a simple ball of yarn, stitch by stitch, and slowly watch it transform into something beautiful. Each completed piece gives me this warm, fuzzy feeling, a reminder that these hands, gifted to me by Allah, can create something meaningful. And as I crochet, I fill each stitch with dhikr and lots of dua, so every creation is wrapped in remembrance and prayer.</p>

            <p>Like any journey, this one has had its ups and downs. In 2023, I lost my ‚Äúcrojo‚Äù (crochet mojo) and stepped away for a while. But in May 2025, between family and studies, I needed a way to de-stress again. So, I picked up my hooks and here I am, rebuilding Fay‚Äôs Crochet with love, patience, dhikr, and renewed passion.</p>
